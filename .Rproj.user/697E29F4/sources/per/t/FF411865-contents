### Maxim of Quality

*During a hurricane* "Lovely weather we're having!" 

- What is this implicating?
  
  - ***this is a lie, they're flouting the maxim of quality***
  
  - ***The weather is terrible***
  
  
  
### Maxim of Quantity

These utterances would still be literally true if Maria could also speak Arabic, or if Enrico could run a whole marathon without stopping. But they'd sound weird. 

- Why is that?

  - ***If Maria speaks 4 languages, then her response was less informative than expected***

  
Mother: Have you done your hw for all your classes yet?

Son: I finished my history hw.

- What is the son implicating

  - ***the son is being less informative than expected in his response***
  
  - ***I didn't finish my other classes' hw***
  
Rafa: What do you do for a living?

Ed: I work.

- Why is Ed's response awkward?

  - ***more info is expected, no new info is given actually***
  
- What might Ed be implicating by flouting the Maxim of Quantity? 

  - ***i hate my job; i don't want to tell you***
  
### Maxim of Relevance

Mike's professor writes: "Mike has good handwriting and dresses neatly" 

- Is this relevant to a grad school application?

  - ***not really***
  
- What is the professor implicating? 

  - ***this student sucks, but i can't directly say that***
  
### Maxim of Manner

"Miss Singer produced a series of sounds corresponding closely to the score of an aria from Rigoletto"

- Why is the critic being so wordy? Why didn't they simply say Miss Singer sang beautifully? 

  - ***they don't want to call what she did music, because they think she did not sing beautifully***

- What are they implicating? 

  - ***she was technically singing close to the score, but nothing else was special about the performance***

## Cancelling and reinforcing implicatures

1. A: What languages does Anna speak? 

  B: Anna speaks English Korean and Farsi
  
  - what does this implicate
  
    - ***Anna speaks only these 3 languages***
    
2. Ian ate a cake and was happy

  - What does this implicate?
  
    - ***Ian ate a cake and that made him happy***
    
3. A: Does Sue have any siblings 

  B: Sue has a brother 
  
  - What does this implicate?
  
    - ***Sue only has one brother***
    
## Cancelling implicatures

1. Ian ate a cake and was happy 

  - think of a statement that you could add that would contradict the implicature: ***In fact, he ate the cake because he was happy***
  
  
2. A: Does Sue have any siblings?

  B: Sue has a brother.
  
  - think of a statement that you could add that would contradict the implicature: ***In fact, she has two brothers***
  
  
## Practice


For each sentence, two additional statements are given â€“ one is part of the sentence's literal meaning, one is an implicature. Try to reinforce/cancel each statement to test whether it is literal or an implicature.

1. I drove home at noon 

  **A:** I drove a car
  
***Reinforce?: ...with my car at noon.***

***Cancel?: Actually, I drove home with my motorcycle.***
  
  **B:** I drove home during the day
  
***Reinforce?: before sunset***

***Cancel?: I drove home after dark***

2. I called 10 times and nobody picked up

  **A:** I called at least 5 times 
  
***Reinforce?: idk??***

***Cancel?: In fact, I called 10 times.***

  
  **B:** I was using a phone
  
  
***Reinforce?: idk??***

***Cancel?: idk??***
