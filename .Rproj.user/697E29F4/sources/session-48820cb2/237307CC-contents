**Pragmatics** is the study of how **context** contributes to meaning or it is the study of <span style="color:green"><b>implied meaning</b></span><br><br>

**presuppositions**<br><br> 
- a type of <span style="color:green"><b>implied</b></span> meaning
- background information that is taken for granted or in the **common ground** for an utterance to make sense<br><br> 

**conversational implicatures**<br><br> 
- another type of <span style="color:green"><b>implied</b></span> meaning
- meaning arises from our understanding of **how people behave** in conversation

## How do conversations work?
<br>
.pull-left[
- Philosopher **Paul Grice** studied how people behave when they're having a conversation <br><br>
- <u>Participants in a conversation</u> (**interlocutors**) tend to collaborate and follow certain rules: <br><br>
  - **NOT** say things that are **irrelevant**<br>
  – <span style="color:green">*How are you today?*</span><br>
  – <span style="color:blue">*false*.</span><br><br>
  - **NOT** say things they believe to be **false**<br>
  – <span style="color:green">*Do you know where the truck is?*</span><br>
  – <span style="color:blue">*On the top of my head*.</span><br><br>
  - **NOT** say **more** or **less** than they need to<br>
  – <span style="color:green">*Do you fancy a cuppa tea or coffee?*</span><br>

- We tend to behave in similar ways whenever we're collaborating on a **common task** with a **common goal** with other people<br><br>
- Imagine Merlin is baking a cake with his mom:<br><br>
 - When she tells him the next step is to stir the butter, what would he do?
 - When she asks him to hand her two eggs, what would he do?<br><br>
- It is the same when we have a conversation, we tend not to say **irrelevant** things or give **more** or **less** information than is required ]

## **Grice's Maxims of Conversation**

.pull-right[
- **maxim of quality**: Be truthful!
  - Don't say what you believe to be false
  - Don't say what you don't have evidence for
- **maxim of quantity**: Be informative!
  - Don't say more than you need to
  - Don't say less than you need to
- **maxim of relevance (relation)**: Be relevant!
  - Don't say irrelevant things
- **maxim of manner**: Be clear!
  - Don't be obscure
  - Don't be ambiguous
  - Don't be too wordy
  - Provide information **in a sensible order**
]
<br><br>
Although they're worded like commands, the maxims are intended to describe how people **tend** to behave or are **assumed** to behave, not how they **ought to** behave

## sometimes we **SEEM TO** break the maxims
<br><br>
.pull-left[
- We generally assume interlocutors are following the **Cooperative Principle** and **conversational maxims**<br><br>
- Yet, sometimes it **seems** we break the maxims:
  - speaker **A**: <span style="color:green">*Do you want to go out tonight?*</span><br>
  - speaker **B**: <span style="color:blue">*I have an exam in the morning*.</span><br><br>
- B said something unrelated to A's topic:
  - violation of **Maxim of Relevance**<br><br>
- B did not answer A's question:
  - violation of **Maxim of Quantity**<br><br>
- What if we assume B is in fact being cooperative and following Grice's maxims?
  - *I can't go out, because I have an exam*.

## Summary
<br>
- **Cooperative Principle**: people in a conversation tend to cooperate by following certain rules<br><br>
- **conversational maxims**: quality, quantity, relevance, manner<br><br>
- **conversational implicatures**: implied meanings that arise from the assumption that speakers are
following the cooperative principle<br><br>
  - this is sometimes because people's words implicate things **beyond what they literally say**
  - it's sometimes because people deliberately **flout** the maxims for ironic or comedic effect
  - implied meaning is used as a way to avoid saying uncomfortable things or to avoid the effort of speaking<br><br>
- That's it for **Pragmatics** – the study of implied meaning and how context contributes to meaning – if
you'd like to learn more, consider taking a Pragmatics class!
